## FileMan
FileMan is a standard file management plugin built for Unreal Engine Blueprints. Use the nodes included to read, write, or delete files.

![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anhuntz/fileman/master/Resources/Nodes.png)
### Nodes:
- Read File
- Write File
- Get Files in Path
- Delete File

### Keep in mind:
These nodes all derive from the project directory, which means the "root" will be seen as the same place your `.uproject` file is located. In packaged games, this root becomes the folder titled with your game name.

### Installation:
To install the plugin, drag the downloaded folder into your Unreal Engine project's "Plugin" folder. When you start your project, you can enable the plugin and get started right away! FileMan was built in UE 4.22, but should work in most versions.

Thank you for using the plugin!
